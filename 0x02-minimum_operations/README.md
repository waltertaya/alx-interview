## Introduction
Welcome to the Minimum Operations project! This project focuses on developing an algorithm to compute the minimum number of operations required to generate a specific number of characters `H` using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations. The challenge involves leveraging algorithmic and mathematical concepts to find the most efficient solution.

## Concepts Needed
To solve this problem effectively, you'll need to understand several key concepts:

1. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Break down the problem into simpler subproblems and build up the solution.
   - [Dynamic Programming (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/)

2. **Prime Factorization**:
   - Perform prime factorization to reduce the problem to finding the sum of the prime factors of the target number `n`.
   - [Prime Factorization (Khan Academy)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/x15a29d8c21d99093:polynomials/x15a29d8c21d99093:factoring-polynomials/v/prime-factorization)

3. **Code Optimization**:
   - Approach problems from an optimization perspective to find the most efficient solution.
   - [How to optimize Python code](https://realpython.com/python-performance/)

4. **Greedy Algorithms**:
   - Apply greedy algorithms by choosing the best option at each step.
   - [Greedy Algorithms (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms/)

5. **Basic Python Programming**:
   - Proficiency in Python, including loops, conditionals, and functions, is necessary to implement the solution.

## Requirements
- **General**:
  - Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
  - All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.4.3
  - All files should end with a new line
  - The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
  - A `README.md` file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
  - Your code should be documented
  - Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
  - All files must be executable

## Tasks

### 0. Minimum Operations
**Mandatory**

In a text file, there is a single character `H`. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number `n`, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` `H` characters in the file.

- **Prototype**: `def minOperations(n)`
- **Returns**: an integer
- If `n` is impossible to achieve, return `0`

**Example**:
```
n = 9

H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste => HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH

Number of operations: 6
```

## Example
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""
Main file for testing
"""

minOperations = __import__('0-minoperations').minOperations

n = 4
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))

n = 12
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))
```

Output:
```
Min number of operations to reach 4 characters: 4
Min number of operations to reach 12 characters: 7
```

## Repository Structure
- **GitHub repository**: `alx-interview`
- **Directory**: `0x02-minimum_operations`
- **File**: `0-minoperations.py`

**Note**: All files should be documented and adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines.
